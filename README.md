# Novocode invoker

This repository contains invoker for the testing system I wrote in 2023, see https://github.com/vvsob/novocode

The invoker uses Redis to get the submissions and to store submission's scores.
Also, it makes use of the `strategy` testing library I wrote.

This repository also contains unit tests written using `pytest`, although there are few.
